# PFSystem

PFSystem is an experimental **Python-based market analysis and signal exploration framework**.

It is designed for:
- systematic observation of price behavior
- structural signal detection (e.g. Point & Figure logic)
- statistical and rule-based filtering
- post-market analysis workflows

PFSystem **does not provide financial advice** and is not a trading bot.
It is a research and learning system built entirely on public knowledge.

## Philosophy

PFSystem follows a few strict principles:

- 📊 **Structure over prediction**  
  Signals describe *state*, not future guarantees.

- 🔍 **Transparency over black boxes**  
  All logic is explicit, inspectable, and reproducible.

- 🧪 **Observation-first**  
  The system is intentionally designed to allow *watching signals evolve* without forced execution.

- 🌱 **Give back to public knowledge**  
  Everything here is derived from public concepts, literature, and experimentation.

## What PFSystem Is

- A modular Python research framework
- A sandbox for market structure analysis
- A tool for studying signal lifecycle (fresh → extended → invalid)
- A personal-but-generalizable system for disciplined analysis

---

## What PFSystem Is NOT

- ❌ A guaranteed trading strategy  
- ❌ A high-frequency system  
- ❌ A financial advisory service  
- ❌ A turnkey “buy/sell” bot  

You are responsible for **all decisions and risks**.

## Core Concepts (High-Level)

PFSystem currently explores:

- End-of-day market scanning
- Liquidity and price filters
- Point & Figure–style structural signals
- Relative strength comparisons
- Signal freshness and extension tracking
- Watchlist-style workflows

Exact implementations may evolve.
